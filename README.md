# CloneDash
 
This is a WIP open-source clone of 'Muse Dash', a parkour-rhythm game combination. It can currently load the base game levels and provides the core gameplay functionality.

This is a hastily-put-together alpha of game functionality. It kind of matches the base gameplay, but there's still work that needs to be done. The current core of the project is a bit of a mess and a lot of this will change as I further work on the project.

There are still a lot of things I'd like to implement that are currently missing, for starters, custom levels. It would be nice to provide a lot of customizability and accessibility options the base game does not allow for as well.

## Building
You should be able to just clone the repository, open it in Visual Studio 2022, and build the game. If there's any issues, let me know and I'll try to resolve them. I don't have other machines to get Mac/Linux support working at the moment.
