The ideal is that we would be able to load this content via the basegame, like we already do for characters.
However, this is currently infeasible both due to how long it takes to load and due to some weird glitches with the model loader.
So for the sake of playability I'm putting this up - especially since for *everything* else you need to have the game content.

We likely need a better asset-ripping library that runs better before we can approach that again.
